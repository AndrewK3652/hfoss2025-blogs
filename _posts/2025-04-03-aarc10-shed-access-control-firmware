# Introduction

For my contribution, I decided to help the RIT SHED Makerspace with their access control firmware. I decided to do this because I am a frequent user of the RIT SHED facilities as a member of RIT Launch Initiative. I saw an opportunity to help improve the custom devices the SHED uses to ensure only authorized and trained users operate the SHED's equipment.
