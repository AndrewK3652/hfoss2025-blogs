# Project Introduction

For my contribution, I decided to help the RIT SHED Makerspace with their access control firmware. I decided to do this because I am a frequent user of the RIT SHED facilities as a member of RIT Launch Initiative. I saw an opportunity to help improve the custom devices the SHED uses to ensure only authorized and trained users operate the SHED's equipment.

The project is currently maintained by SHED employees, but is open-sourced under a Creative Commons license. However, since it is lesser known that some of SHED's software (and hardware) is open-sourced, there is little outside attention given to it. The reason I knew about it was because I the person that mostly maintains these projects, Jim Heaney. Therefore, I thought it would also be a good opportunity to work with him towards improving the software since he mostly comes from a hardware background. After getting approval from my TA Adrian, I decided to start contributing with a massive overhaul to the access control firmware.

## Issues Found
Since Jim mainly specializes in hardware, there were several potential issues I identified before starting. The following include

- Race Conditions
- Delay Drift
- Ungraceful Error Handling
- Buffer Overflows

## Fixes
Thankfully, the file structure was organized enough to modify each file one a time for the most part. I went through each file individually, making changes as I saw fit. 

## Community Interaction
Unfortunately, due to lack of access to hardware I have been unable to personally test my changes on the hardware itself. However, part of the purpose of the assignment was to interact with a community and since this project doesn't really have many external contributors, I was able to work with Jim in person. This also allowed me to teach Jim new software techniques to incorporate into his future work as well.
