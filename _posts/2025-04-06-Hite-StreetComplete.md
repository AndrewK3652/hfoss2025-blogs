# Project Introduction

I chose to work on StreetComplete because it is a fantastic system to add information to OpenStreetMap. While looking into how to contribute to this project I realized that the documentation appears to be chronically subpar. I decided to help improve the wiki to improve the documentation for StreetComplete

# Finding an issue

StreetComplete has a fairly simple way to track issues and proposed changes. However it appears that the issue tracker entries for new features and any bugs appear to take a at least three weeks to get someone to start working on a bug and usually longer to add a new feature. 

Since December 2023 it appears that most of the work on StreetComplete has been focused on producing an IOS version of StreetComplete. Because of all of this focus on producing an IOS app and whatever remaining effort on the program is going to focusing on the bug reports and feature requests there has been little to no work on updating the docs for StreetComplete.
