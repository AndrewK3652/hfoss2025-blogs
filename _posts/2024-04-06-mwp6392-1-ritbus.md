RIT Bus (hosted at [https://rit-bus.app](https://rit-bus.app) at time of
writing) is a FOSS (GPL) project for viewing the RIT bus schedule in a more
easily understandable way. The project scrapes RIT's bus schedule website, then
presents that information to the user as a 'live' update of when each bus will
be at its next stop.

My Comm Arch group decided to cover this project for our final presentation. All
of our members thought that it would be a good project to contribute to.
Additionally, Adrian (our TA) knows the developer of the application and
recommended it as a good project to contribute to.

The project provides somewhat comprehensive documentation for how to setup a
development environment; however, I did have to parse through some configuration
files to figure out how to setup a connection to an external service.

## The Issue

I decided to work on an issue that dealt with creating a Docker configuration
because I recently configured a Docker setup for my senior project. I decided to
create a simple postgres container using Docker compose that pulls from the
existing environment variable setup. The change worked first try out of the box.
